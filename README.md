# COVID-19 scripts

## Status
A work in progress. Fetches data for all US counties and adds per 100,000 rates.

## Goals
* Get the most fine-grained data possible per region. Currently we have a county-level data for the US, but only a single figure for most other countries
* For each region we get figures for, get up-to-date population data so we can generate per capita figures
* Correct for very variable levels of testing between regions

## requirements
`node` and `yarn`

## Steps
`yarn install`

`yarn start`
